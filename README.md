I'm a passionate programmer, lifelong learner, and dedicated instructor based in São Paulo, Brazil. I like to think of myself as a "planeswalker of programming languages," always exploring new technologies and seeking mastery in my craft.

Currently, I'm a Technical Specialist at the Insper VR and Digital Games Lab, where I support students and create demos. My primary focus is on Game Development, XR (VR/AR), and Computer Graphics, but I also have a strong background in Full-Stack Web Development. I have a vocation for instructing and love sharing knowledge.

# 🚀 My Tech Stack & Skills

I'm comfortable working across a wide range of technologies. Here are some of the tools and languages I enjoy using:
